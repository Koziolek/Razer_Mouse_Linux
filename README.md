# Razer Mouse Linux
..also can accept other devices by adding the files. Contact me to add devices. Currently supporting X11.

Now with app auto profiles !

!!! ONE LINE INSTALL !!! :

`sudo apt install unzip wget -y && wget https://codeload.github.com/lostallmymoney/Razer_Mouse_Linux/zip/refs/heads/master -O Razer_Mouse_Linux.zip && unzip Razer_Mouse_Linux.zip && cd Razer_Mouse_Linux && sudo sh install.sh && cd .. && rm -rf Razer_Mouse_Linux-master Razer_Mouse_Linux.zip`

Or run sh install.sh from the directory to install.


## COMMANDS :

	`naga start <optional:configName>` 		//Starts a daemon with the optional config name.	
	`naga edit <optional:configName>` 		//Edits naga config, then starts with optional config name.
	`naga stop`					//stops the daemon.
	`naga fix`					//Restarts usb services.
	`naga uninstall` 				//Uninstalls the daemon tool.
	`naga` 						//Gives help.


If there is an error about config files just copy it to your /home/.naga/

Run in root if there is an error accessing the device.

Map razer naga devices keys with the config file : `keyMap.txt` under `$HOME/.naga/`

## REQUIRES : libx11-dev xdotool xinput g++ libxtst-dev libxmu-dev nano pkexec procps
	If you are running something else than ubuntu and it's not compiling theses are the packages to find.

Probably works with :
- Razer Naga Epic Chroma in CentOS 7
- Razer Naga Epic (pre-2014 version) in Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04, 15.10
- Razer Naga (RZ01-0028) (thanks to khornem) in Ubuntu 14.04
- Razer Naga Molten (thanks to noobxgockel) in Linux Mint 17.02
- Razer Chroma (thanks to felipeacsi) in Manjaro
- Razer Naga 2012 (RZ01-0058) (thanks to mrlinuxfish, brianfreytag) in Arch Linux, Ubuntu 16.04
- Razer Naga Chroma (thanks to ipsod) in Linux Mint KDE 18.1
- Razer Naga Trinity (thanks to haringsrob and ws141)
- Razer Pro Wireless (thanks to Stibax)

Works for sure with :
- Razer Naga 2014 (Debian)

This tool doesn't modify any files except `$HOME/.naga/`, `/etc/udev/rules.d/80-naga.rules` and `/usr/local/bin/(naga && nagaXinputStart.sh)`, so deleting the files deletes the tool.

Make sure to add the users to the group razer with the command `sudo gpasswd -a "$(whoami)" razer` if you create a new user.

CAUTION, in this alpha version the run option wont work for text environment commands, like for example `top`.
As an alpha version, there might be bugs.

## CONFIGURATION
The configuration file `keyMap.txt` has the following syntax:

    "config="<configName> set the name of the following config. The initial loaded config will always be <configName> = defaultConfig .

    <keynumber> - <option>=<command>

    <keynumber> is a number between 1-14 representing the 12 keys of the naga's keypad + two on the top of the naga.

    <option> decides what is going to be applied to <command>

	The possible choices are :
		-chmap : Changes the keymap for another config inside `keymap.txt` in ~/.naga .
		-champRelease : Changes the keymap on key release.
		-sleep and sleepRelease :
			Sleeps
		-string and stringRelease :
			Writes a string, doesn't use xdotool so xdotool keys won't work
			
		-key : does keyPress at press and keyRelease at release
		-specialKey : does speical keyPress at press and special keyRelease at release.
		-keyPressOnPress :
			The xdotool key is pressed when the key is pressed.
		-keyReleaseOnRelease :
			The xdotool key is released when the key is released.			
		-keyPressOnRelease :
			The xdotool key is pressed when the key is released.
		-keyReleaseOnPress :
			The xdotool key is released when the key is pressed.
			There seems to be a list of keys on https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/x11proto/plain/keysymdef.h but you need to remove **XK_** and they're not all there so google them if you want to be sure.
		-run : Runs the command <command> on key press with setsid before the command.
		-run2 : Runs the command without setsid.
		-runRelease : Runs a bash command when the button is released .
		-runRelease2 : Runs the command without setsid when button released.
		-setWorkspace : Runs <command> in **xdotool set_desktop <command>** .
		-mousePosition : Runs <command> in **xdotool mousemove <command>** .
		-keyClick : Press a key once when the button is pressed .
		-keyClickRelease : Press a key once when the button is released .
		
		#Use theses to press/unpress special chars that won't work using xdotool
		-specialPressOnPress : Supports 1 char only...
		-specialPressOnRelease : 1 char
		-specialReleaseOnPress : 1 char
		-specialReleaseOnRelease : 1 char

    		<command> is what is going to be used based on the option.

		To test any <command> run it in the command cited above.

		"configEnd" Marks the end of a config.
		
		For a mouseclick run xdotool click <command>) (Can put numbers from 1 to 9 and options such as *--window etc).

You may have as many configs as you want in the keyMap.txt file, just make sure to give them different names and include defaultConfig.

### NOTES

To reload the config run the command :
	naga start

which will restart the daemon

If ran as root you should edit the file in /root/.naga.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If the `$HOME/.naga/keyMap.txt` file is missing the daemon won't start (the program will NOT autocreate this file, the install.sh script will copy an example file though).

For a key multiple actions may be defined. They will then be executed sequentially at the key press.

An example `keyMap.txt` configuration file is the following:

    #Comments should be accepted
    config=defaultConfig
    1 - key=XF86AudioPlay
    3 - chmap=420configEnemyBlazerWoW
    4 - run=notify-send 'Button # 4' 'Pressed'
    #etc
    configEnd

    config=420configEnemyBlazerWoW
    1 - run=sh ~/hacks.sh
    2 - chmap=defaultConfig
    #etc
    configEnd

If you want to dig more into configuration, you might find these tools useful: `xinput`, `evtest`

Any non existing functionality can be created through the "run" option.

## INSTALLATION

Dependencies : `xdotool`, `xinput` and `g++`

Edit `src/naga.cpp` to adapt the installation to another device, using different inputs and/or different key codes than the Naga Epic, 2014, Molten or Chroma. For Example, Epic Chroma is compatible with Epic (they have the same buttons), so you would only have to add an additional line to the devices vector.

Run `sh install.sh` .
This will compile the source and copy the necessary files (see `install.sh` for more info).
It will prompt you for your password, as it uses sudo to copy some files.
The config files are copied to all the users (even root) homes.

## Autorun

Since autorun is a bit complicated for all the distros you can simply add nagastart.desktop or a script executing naga start to your startup folder/configuration.
(Might have to run chmod +x on the .desktop)

If you ever were to login as root then unlog and log as another user the daemon might ask you for your password to kill the rooted daemon. If the device still doesn't work after root access, unplugging and replugging the device then starting the daemon will surely work.


#### In depth


1) In order to get rid of the original bindings it disables the keypad using xinput as follows:

    $ xinput set-int-prop [id] "Device Enabled" 8 0

where [id] is the id number of the keypad returned by $ xinput.

2) You may have to also run

    $ xinput set-button-map [id2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 11 10 8 9 13 14 15

where [id2] is the id number of the pointer device returned by `xinput` - in case of naga 2014 you also have to check which of those two has more than 7 numbers by typing `xinput get-button-map [id2]`. Although this seems to be unnecessary in some systems (i.e CentOS 7)

## UNINSTALLATION

To uninstall you need to run `naga uninstall` .
